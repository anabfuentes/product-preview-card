## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to continue to read up on and figure out useful implementations of CSS Grid. I primarily use Flexbox, but there were a few moments during coding for this project that Grid seemed simpler, so I definitely want to become more knowledgable in this CSS area.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

To figure how to change the main image based on the mobile and desktop breakpoints, I followed along with a tutorial [Kevin Powell](https://youtube.com/kevinpowell) has available on YouTube. After watching his solution, I saw there were a lot of great CSS methods he used that I tried out in my code as well. Thanks so much for making your tutorial available and showing me new, to me, CSS tricks!
